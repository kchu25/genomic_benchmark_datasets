# genomic_benchmark_datasets

This is just a quick and dirty script to extract datasets from https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/genomic_benchmarks as fasta files. 
All the fasta file has each entry in the following format:
```
> <class>
<DNA string>
```
where ```<something>``` depends on the original data.

If you find these datasets useful don't forget to cite them: check https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/genomic_benchmarks
